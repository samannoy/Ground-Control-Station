# Ground-Control-Station V1

This is a code in development to create a simple GUI for a ground control station. The GCS will display AHRS information, artificial horizon/ HUD and also plot the roll, pitch, groundspeed, IMU, altitude for current and set values
The HUD will act as OSD for displaying battery level and heading along with some other values.
The empty screen on the right will be used for future applications as desired.

The GCS will also act as a telemetry control device to send action commands to the drone.

The feature_sam branch currently deals with the GCS design and backend.
The other branches deal with Maps integration with the GCS and will be implemented later.
